                  "Alright so - why do you say if you transfer money you will have to pay taxes on it? If it was taxed fund that was deposited in the bank account in US, you will not be taxed again. You should be able to write a USD check and deposit it in your non NRI account without any issues.\nMy personal take is white to black transactions are less favorable for people holding white money, you have a lot more to lose as your money is tracked in the system. Not to mention funds in most cases are tax paid and you are trading it for money that is not tax paid.",
