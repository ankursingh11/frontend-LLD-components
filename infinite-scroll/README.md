## infinite-scroll ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤˜
To implement this demo, we need to understand some js terminologies : <br/>
1.   `document.body.scrollHeight` : total height of the body/webpage <br/>
2.  `window.innerHeight` : the visible section height / height of the viewport<br/>
3.  `window.scrollY` : how much we have scrolled<br/>
<br/>
Now `infinite-scroll` depends on the fact that whether we have reached the end of the page or not and here is how we can check this <br/>
1. We can attach an `eventListener` to the `scroll` event.<br/>

```
window.addEventListener("scroll", handleScroll);
```

2. As soon as we scroll, it will fire a function `handleScroll` which will check whether we have reached the end of the page or not. Here is how we can check that
```
function  handleScroll() {
 if (window.innerHeight  +  window.scrollY  >=  document.body.scrollHeight) {
  fetchMemes();
 }
}
```
