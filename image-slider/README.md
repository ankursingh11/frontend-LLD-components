## image-slider ğŸ¤“ğŸ¤˜
For this demo, i used some random images. <br/>
The logic is pretty simpe :
1. To have the index, we can use a state, `index` which will store the index of the current image to be shown and we can store all our images in an array
```
const [currIndex, setIndex] =  useState(0);
.
const IMAGES = [img1, img2, img3, img4, img5];
```
2. To show next image, we can have the followling logic
```
function nextImage() {
  setIndex(index  => (index+1)%DATA.length);
}
```
3. And to show prev image
```
function prevImage() {
  setIndex(index  =>  index-1<0?DATA.length-1:index-1);
}
```
Thats it ğŸ¥¸ <br/>
